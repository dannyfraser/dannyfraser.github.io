## ‘An inquiry into my practice for managing change with STiP’

2024-11-16

The principal question I've taken away from this exercise is: am I performing an inquiry into a situation of change, or is inquiry into *my approach to managing change*? Perhaps it's both, given the module's stress of the importance of continual self-reflection.

At the moment it's difficult to pick a single situation of concern for the inquiry (if indeed that is the task!), as my work situation is going through an enormous amount of organisational change, but I'm less of an active participant in that process and more of a passenger on a journey with decisions being made by senior leaders in the company. An option for inquiry here is to look into how I manage  my practice and my team's role throughout this programme of change.
